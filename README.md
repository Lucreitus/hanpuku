Hanpuku is an interface between d3.js and Adobe Illustrator, enabling a more flexible
data visualization workflow. Data bindings no longer disappear when you edit a d3-generated
graphic in Illustrator; those bindings now survive custom edits, and even
get saved inside native .ai files.

On the flip side, your custom Illustrator edits
will also survive properly-written d3.js scripts: now, when your data changes after
you've done lots of hand-crafted awesomeness, you don't have to start over from scratch!

Another cool addition is that Illustrator and d3.js selections are merged; you can now
set attributes for stuff you have selected in Illustrator like a normal d3.js selection. You can
even filter the current Illustrator selection based on data, or perform complex selections right from
the code!
