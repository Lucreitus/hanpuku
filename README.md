# hanpuku #

Hanpuku is an interface between d3.js and Adobe Illustrator, enabling a more flexible
data visualization workflow. Data bindings no longer disappear when you edit a d3-generated
graphic in Illustrator; those bindings now survive custom edits, and even
get saved inside native .ai files.

On the flip side, your custom Illustrator edits
will also survive properly-written d3.js scripts: now, when your data changes after
you've done lots of hand-crafted awesomeness, you don't have to start over from scratch!

Another cool addition is that Illustrator and d3.js selections are merged; you can now
set attributes for stuff you have selected in Illustrator like a normal d3.js selection. You can
even filter the current Illustrator selection based on data, or perform complex selections right from
the code!

Installation
------------

### Installing the Adobe Add-on
The easiest way\* to install Hanpuku is via the [Adobe Add-ons](https://creative.adobe.com/addons/products/15087) page. Note that, for hard-core developers, you will probably still need to follow Step 2 below to peek at the DOM with Chrome's developer tools.

\* Okay, "easy" is a bit of an exaggeration. Adobe's add-on system is *very* broken. In practice, I've found that you have to mess with your Creative Cloud settings, and possibly completely uninstall / reinstall Illustrator itself to get it to work. Even when it does work, it can take a few minutes for extensions to show up in the Creative Cloud "Activity Stream" (the Home tab of the desktop app) after clicking "Install"... and only then can you quit / reopen Illustrator to see it in action. If you run into any of these issues, installing from source may be easier.

### Installing from the source code
This way is a little trickier, but many users (myself included) have had problems with Adobe Add-ons. If you've tried the Add-on approach, it's a good idea to click "Remove" on the add-on page before you start, just to be safe.

#### Step 1
With Illustrator closed, open the terminal and type or paste these commands:

```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/
mkdir CEP
mkdir CEP/extensions
cd CEP/extensions
git clone https://github.com/alex-r-bigelow/hanpuku.git
```

If you don't have git installed on your system, you can download the [zipped source code](https://github.com/alex-r-bigelow/hanpuku/archive/master.zip), extract it, and type this instead of the last line:
```
mv ~/Downloads/hanpuku-master ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/hanpuku
```

#### Step 2
Illustrator won't normally load the extension unless it's cryptographically signed. The Add-on installation process should handle this for you, but if you're installing from the source code, you'll have to disable this check. You also have to do this step if you want to poke at the DOM using Chrome's developer tools.

Open `~/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.CSXS.7.plist` with a plain text editor (TextEdit *won't* do this correctly; use something like TextWrangler). To find the file in the Finder, you might need to hit `Command+Shift+G`, and paste that path.

Add `<key>PlayerDebugMode</key>` and `<string>1</string>` so the file looks like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>LogLevel</key>
	<string>1</string>
	<key>PlayerDebugMode</key>
	<string>1</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### Step 3
You should now be able to launch Illustrator and open the Hanpuku extension window.

### Troubleshooting
If encounter problems, please file an issue with the following information:
- Include the version of Illustrator that you're running on ("Illustrator CC" -> "About Illustrator...")
- Assuming you've done Step 2, you should be able to navigate to [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088). There you should see an "index.html" linkâ€”if you click it, it will bring up Chrome's developer tools in the regular browser window. Please report any errors you see on the Console.

Work in progress:
-----------------
#### Crazy ideas to explore
- Sync with Chrome dev tools (create a Hanpuku Chrome extension for smooth two-way transitions?)
- Add better, cleaner import / export / copy / paste features for full HTML or SVG snippets
  - Provide more user control about what gets imported / exported / copied / pasted:
    - Options to handle CSS rules that apply to snippets (but the rules themselves may live off in a stylesheet somewhere)?
    - Options to control whether / how D3 bindings, event bindings, and other javascript properties that aren't in the HTML can be preserved
      - (does any of this change with Illustrator's new-ish, yet still freakishly limiting variable / "graph" data binding approaches? Is there a better way to integrate?)
    - Other options besides my mandatory SVG element = Illustrator artboard interpretation
    - Controls to preserve rects as rects instead of converting everything to paths all the time?
    - Text conversion issues are extremely messy internally - I should probably expose these issues rather than impose them myself

#### Known bugs
- Text rotation / scale bugs
- Links to Swatch colors are lost (need to do a true diff model...?)
- Arc approximation irregularities
- Duplicate path endpoints
- Need to turn off perspective grid or isolation mode temporarily (if they're on) in domToDoc, or stuff dies (how to do this with jsx?)

#### High priority
- Replace textareas with ace editors, better file saving / organization / syncing
- Better font support
- Bitmap support
- Gradient support
- Mask support
- Symbol support
- Stroke properties (dashes, caps, etc.)

#### Medium priority
- Regex search/replace in text editors (esp. data)
- Circular data in the Data preview (visualize cycles)
- More examples
- Proper CMYK color
- Export as/to web page
- Add some kind of placeholder in each environment for unsupported items like blends/graphs, or videos/form elements?

#### Low priority
- Implement non-programmer UX
- Embed the Chrome debugging window as a view
- Embed data, js, css files inside the .ai file (preserve layer-level properties while I'm at it)
- Load multiple js, css files, distinguish between js libraries and scripts (run the former immediately)

#### Very low priority
- Investigate what it would take to make an Inkscape clone / make Hanpuku an independent application
- Test on Windows
- Tangelo integration / streaming data support
