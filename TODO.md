### TODO:

#### Known bugs
- Selection overlay bug
- Links to Swatch colors are lost
- New Illustrator text position (there's no M_0...)
- Double-apply text position bug (probably not just text!)
- Arc approximation irregularities
- Duplicate path endpoints

#### High priority
- Font support
- Bitmap support
- Gradient support
- Mask support
- Symbol support
- Stroke properties (dashes, cap, etc.)

#### Medium priority
- Replace textareas with ace editors
- Regex search/replace in text editors (esp. data)
- Circular data in the Data preview (visualize cycles)
- More examples
- Proper CMYK color
- Export as/to web page
- Add some kind of placeholder in each environment for unsupported items like blends/graphs, or videos/form elements?

#### Low priority (probably next paper)
- Design non-programmer UX
- Change to modal dialog?
- Embed the Chrome debugging window as a view
- Embed data, js, css files inside the .ai file (preserve layer-level properties while I'm at it)
- Load multiple js, css files, distinguish between js libraries and scripts (run the former immediately)

#### Very low priority
- Investigate what it would take to make an Inkscape clone / make it an independent app
- Test on Windows
- Tangelo integration / streaming support
